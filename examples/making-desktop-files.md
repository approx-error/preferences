# Information on making .desktop files for launching programs

Inspired by the hours I spent trying to make a custom launch script for an application work

## 1 - What are .desktop files

In brief, .desktop files are configuration files, that describe how to launch a given program,
the name of the program's desktop shortcut, the icon of the program and so on. Every launchable
"program" on the desktop of your computer is actually a .desktop file describing how to actually
run the program. Your desktop is a directory just like any other and is usually located in your
home directory under the name 'Desktop'. If you place a .desktop file there, a graphical icon
representation of it will be shown on you computer's desktop.
