# approx-error/preferences

A repository of preferences, templates, customization files and small scripts I have found useful. 
These mostly consist of [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) configuration files, [ultisnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) snippets and LaTeX commands.
There are also some example files for correct syntax when using certain tools/languages that I keep coming back to for reference so might as well put them here.
I don't expect anyone else to find a use for these but in case someone does, they will be waiting here.
