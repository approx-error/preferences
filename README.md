# approx-error/preferences

A repository of preferences, templates and customization files I have found useful. 
These mostly consist of [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) configuration files, [ultisnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) snippets and LaTeX commands.
I don't expect anyone to find a use for these but in case someone does (or I need them when using a new computer), they will be waiting here.
